This is a readme file for starting with C programming. All the best to me

0-preprocessor runs a C file at preprocessor and outputs to  a different file C

1-compiler runs a C file but does not link

2-assembler assembles a Cfile and save it in an output file

3-name compiles a C file and creates an executable file

4-puts.c creates a C program

5-printf.c uses printf for output

6-size.c prints the size of the various data types

100-intel generates an assembly code (intel syntax)

101-quote.c prints an output without printf
